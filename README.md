# arg_gc
Code for the analysis of the antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) dissemination across the global plasmidome.

The idea of this project is to systematically assess the dissemination of ARG analyzing their %GC distribution in the PLSDB plasmid database. The code located in this repository works (1) predicting ARG in the PLSDB database using the CARD protein sequences as queries, (2) retrieving the predicted ARG and host %GC content, (3) computing the dissemination index using protein similarity and %GC data.
